# Task Manager

## The Problem
Quite frankly, there are far too many things to do in a single day. Whether it may be walking the dog, or even just finishing the coding assignment that you put off a few days ago, it sometimes feels overwhelming when you take a step back to process how much we actually have to do. That's when I decided that I genuinely wanted to make a task manager application!
