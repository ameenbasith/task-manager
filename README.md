# Task Manager
Task manager application carried out in Javascript.

## The Problem
Quite frankly, there are far too many things to do in a single day. Whether it may be walking the dog, or even just finishing the coding assignment that you put off a few days ago, it sometimes feels overwhelming when you take a step back to process how much we actually have to do. 

That's when I decided that I genuinely wanted to make a task manager application!

## The Solution
Although I had a fairly straight forward idea in regards to how I wanted to structure this project, I decided to go one step further, as I genuinely wanted to know how challenging this project could get. That's when I stumbled upon this YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIsj0upCBAM&t=434s 

I made some changes to the color scheme of the final product, and here is a quick demonstration below:

Initially, I wasn't too keen on following a YouTube tutorial to create this application, however, I genuinely learned a lot more than I expected!

## What I learned
Much to my surprise, this program was much more complicated than I initially anticipated. I had to build a REST API and utilized MongoDB + Postman to build my understanding of Node.js. I felt as if this was an incredible introduction to the topic, and I found it highly valuable!
